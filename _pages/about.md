I am a hardware enthusiast interested in Computer Architecture and VLSI.

I study Electrical and Electronics Engineering at the [National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal](https://www.nitk.ac.in/).

I am currently a Student Developer at [Free and Open Source Silicon (FOSSi) Foundation](https://fossi-foundation.org) under [Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2020](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com).

I love open-source projects and always excited for collaboration on the same.

I have worked in the [Wadwani Electronics Lab, EE Dept, IIT Bombay](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~wel_iitb/) during Summer of 2019 and will be joining [CAD Lab, SERC, IISc Bengaluru](http://cadl.iisc.ernet.in/) soon for my undergraduate thesis project.
