I am a hardware enthusiast interested in Computer Architecture and VLSI.

I love open-source projects like those based on RISC-V and always open for projects and collaboration on the same.

I have worked in the [Wadwani Electronics Lab, EE Dept, IIT Bombay](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~wel_iitb/) and will be joining [CAD Lab, SERC, IISc Bengaluru](http://cadl.iisc.ernet.in/) soon for my undergraduate thesis project.
