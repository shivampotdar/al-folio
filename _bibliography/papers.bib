	abstract = {With the rising popularity of e-learning through means like Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), remote-triggered and virtual laboratories, new and innovative technologies for enhancing the learning experience are in demand. E-learning resources for electronics hardware are generally simulation-based, as getting access to high-end hardware is difficult for students due to cost and availability. In this paper, a novel method to create a remotely-accessible, low-cost, modular, and scalable hardware learning platform is proposed and demonstrated through a prototype. Users can interact with the system through a web interface anytime-anywhere and verify results on actual hardware through real-time visual and textual feedback and learn at their pace. The prototype demonstrates a web application hosted on a Linux-PC server interacting with a Raspberry Pi. Student activities are logged in a database for future reference and correction by instructors. The software stack used for the system is free and open-source. The prototype system was launched on a pilot run, gaining positive feedback from students and teachers. Hence, such a system can undergo comprehensive implementation in educational institutions and for the delivery of MOOCs with minimal investment for both laboratory setups and learners.}
